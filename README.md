# CS50 - Educational Assignment

This repository contains assignments completed as part of the CS50 AI course offered by Harvard University. The solutions and code within this repository are primarily for educational and reference purposes. Please avoid using this code if you are currently enrolled in the course and working on these assignments to uphold academic integrity standards.

If you are a student currently enrolled in CS50, it's recommended not to refer to or replicate this code for your own assignments. Instead, engage with the course materials and complete the tasks independently.

This repository is a showcase of my understanding and approach to solving problems presented in the CS50 course and serves as a reference for others interested in learning or exploring similar concepts.
